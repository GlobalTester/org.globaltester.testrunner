<!-- Todo Anke: Other cards, that can be used for testing, e.g. "Geldkarte"?-->
   In a few steps, this cheat sheet will guide you through the execution of TestCases and evaluation of the respective results.
     You will need a card reader and an ePassport. You can also use an nPA, but then switch any
     statements regarding nPA with ePassport and vice-versa.

      <description>
         Make sure your card reader is connected to your computer. First, do not put your ePassport on it.
         If your card reader just had to be connected, start GlobalTester again or update the reader list 
         in the Preferences (Select &quot;Window -> Preferences -> GlobalTester -> SmartCardShell&quot;, 
         activate "Manual setting ..." there and click the "Refresh Reader List" button).

         If not already done, import the &quot;GlobalTester Sample TestSpecification&quot;.

         title="Create TestCampaign">
      <description>
        In your &quot;GlobalTester Sample TestSpecification&quot;, select the TestCases &quot;nPA/nPA_Application.xml&quot;
        and &quot;ePassport/ePassport_Application.xml&quot;.
        Right-click your mouse, and choose <b>&quot;Create TestCampaign&quot;</b>.<br/>
        A TestCampaign will be created in your workspace.

         title="Run TestCampaign">
      <description>
        To execute the newly created TestCampaign select the campaign file in the campaign project and click
        &quot;Run TestCampaign&quot; after opening the context menu.
        Both TestCases will have a &quot;FAILURE&quot; - notice in their &quot;Status&quot;-column in the TestCampaign editor.

         title="Try to find the Error in your Log File">
      <description>
      	In the TestCampaign editor, you can see a tree view displaying the last execution of the TestCampaign structured in its TestCase and Test Steps.
        Right-click with your mouse on the root of the tree view which corresponds to the last execution of the TestCampaign,
        and choose <b>&quot;Show log file&quot;</b>.
        The log file will open. Have a close look at it.<br/>
        You can find your error in the TestCase execution by looking for &quot;@FailureID1&quot;, &quot;@FailureID2&quot;, etc.
        The corresponding line in the log file will have a red marker.
        When you click on it, the line where the failure is reported will open and be highlighted.<br/>
        Usually &quot;@FailureID1&quot; is the essential source of error; here it is the missing &quot;card&quot; reference
        (because you have no card placed on your reader).

         title="Execute TestCampaign with different Setup">
      <description>
      	Now put your ePassport on the card reader.
        You can (re-) execute your TestCampaign by clicking the <b>&quot;Run TestCampaign&quot;</b> command in the toolbar.
        This time the &quot;nPA_Application&quot; execution will report a failure as well,
        but the &quot;ePassport_Application&quot; execution will be declared as &quot;PASSED&quot;.
      </description>

   <item
         title="Evaluate Log File again...">
      <description>
        Open the log file of the &quot;ePassport_Application&quot; execution.
        Now you can see the communication between the card and the reader.
        The command APDU is syntax highlighted.
        When you hover over it, you can see information about the command APDU.
        The response APDU is shown as well, and its status word is extracted.

   <item
         title="... and again.">
      <description>
      	Open the log file of the &quot;nPA_Application&quot; execution.
        This time there is a &quot;card&quot; reference, so there is also a command APDU in the execution.
        The response APDU is only the status word &quot;6a82&quot;, because there is no nPA related eID application on your card.

         title="Generate Report">
      <description>
        You can generate a report of your execution by clicking the <b>&quot;Generate Report&quot;</b> button.
        A folder browser will open where you can choose the folder you want the report to be saved in.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Browse TestCampaign Executions">
      <description>
        Above the tree view you will find a selection
        box where you can switch the display between the different executions to
        compare the results. Have a look at the previous execution and you can easily see the different results.
