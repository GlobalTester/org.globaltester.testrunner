	<h1>TestCampaign</h1>
	<p>
	A <b>TestCampaign</b> is a collection of TestCases and their Executions.
	The collection of TestCases is static and is not intended to be changed after the TestCampaign is created.
	The Executions are the dynamic part of a TestCampaign, and you can start them as often as you like.
	</p>
	<p>
	Information of each execution is saved.
	It covers the start time of the execution, the duration, the result, a link to the log file and to the line the logging starts,
	and to the TestCase resource itself.<br>
	You can see and browse the information, and open log files and TestCases in the TestCampaign editor.<br>
	You can also generate a <a href="../concepts/Report.html">report</a> of your last execution.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <a href="../concepts/LogFiles.html">log files</a> of the TestCampaign executions will be stored in the folder TestResults.
	If that option was set in the Preferences, the single log files for each TestCase will be stored there as well.
