	<h1>Execute TestCases</h1>
	<p>In a few steps, you will be able to create a TestCampaign out of
		TestCases in your TestSpecification and evaluate them. In order to get
		a quick overview, you can also use the Cheat Sheet.</p>

	<h2>Setup Test Environment</h2>
	<p>
		Make sure your card reader is connected to your computer.<br> If
		you still have to connect it and GlobalTester is already running, 
		GlobalTester 3 will not be able to recognize and embed it into its 
		functionality.
		So please start GlobalTester again in this case.
		<br> Place your card on the reader.
	</p>

	<h2>Import your TestSpecification</h2>
	<p>
		If not already done, import one or more <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.globaltester.testspecification.doc/html/user/gettingstarted/UserGuide_ImportOfATestSpec.html">TestSpecification(s)</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Create and execute TestCampaign</h2>
	<p>
		In the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen, select the TestCases you
		want to execute. Right-click with your mouse, and choose <b>&quot;Create
			TestCampaign&quot;</b>. A TestCampaign will be created and opened in the
		TestCampaign Editor. It consists of your selected TestCases, the
		execution states, the log files documenting the test results, and the
		subset of the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen (i.e. the TestCases
		you have chosen).<br> You can (re-) execute your TestCampaign by
		clicking the <b>&quot;Execute&quot;</b> button.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also a shortcut to create and execute a TestCampaign
		directly:<br> In the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen, select
		the TestCases you want to execute. Right-click with your mouse, and
		this time choose <b>&quot;Run Test&quot;</b>.<br> A TestCampaign
		will be created and executed directly. Of course you can execute it
		again by selecting or opening it and click the <b>&quot;Run
			Test&quot;</b> command in the toolbar.
	</p>

	<h2>Evaluate Log File(s)</h2>
	<p>
		Each execution of a TestCampaign will have an own <a
			href="../concepts/LogFiles.html">log file</a>. You can see the whole
		communication between the card and the reader, because the output of
		chip and reader of all executed TestCases is logged there.<br> If
		you have selected &quot;Add separate logfile for each testcase&quot;
		in the Preferences, each executed TestCase will have its own log file.<br>
		You can easily access the log files:
	</p>
	<p>
		In the TestCampaign editor, you can see a tree view displaying the
		last execution of the TestCampaign structured in its sub-parts.
		Right-click with your mouse on the root of the tree view which
		corresponds to the last execution of the TestCampaign, and choose <b>&quot;Show
			log file&quot;</b>. The log file of the last execution of the
		TestCampaign will open.<br> You can access the corresponding log
		of each part of a TestCampaign the same way.<br> For example, if
		you have selected the option for single log files for each TestCase in
		the preferences, logs of TestCases and their parts will be opened in
		the log file for the corresponding TestCase execution.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have a <b>&quot;Failure&quot;</b> notice in the TestCampaign
		editor after an execution, you can find the error in the TestCase
		execution by looking for &quot;@FailureID1&quot;,
		&quot;@FailureID2&quot;, etc. The corresponding lines in the log file
		will have a red marker. When you click on it, the line where
		the failure is quoted will be highlighted in the log file editor.<br>
		Usually &quot;@FailureID1&quot; is the essential source of error. For
		example, if you have no card placed on your reader, it will be the
		missing &quot;card&quot; reference.
	</p>
	<p>The APDU commands are syntax highlighted, and if you hover over
		it with your mouse, the APDU command is declared in its parts.</p>
	<p>
		The response APDUs are also highlighted and thus can be easily
		spotted. Status words are extracted and interpreted.<br> They can
		be checked, and be another source for a &quot;Failure&quot; notice.
	</p>

	<h2>Generate Report</h2>
	<p>
		You can generate a <a href="../concepts/Report.html">report</a> of
		your execution by clicking the <b>&quot;Generate Report&quot;</b>
		button. A folder browser will open where you can choose the folder you
		want the report to be saved in.<br> The report comprises the
		details of your TestCampaign execution with results of each TestCase
		in a more human-readable way than the log files.
	</p>

	<h2>Browse TestCampaign Executions</h2>
	<p>While evaluating the log files, you already used the execution
		tree view in the TestCampaignEditor. Above you will find a selection
		box where you can switch the display between different executions to
		compare the results of several test runs. Also you can modify the
		comments, view the logs and generate reports for older executions as
		the complete state is persisted.</p>
